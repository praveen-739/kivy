if you import like, from kivy.uix.label import Lable   ,then in def build(self): return label(text="hello!")
here in return if you  use, return label(text="hello",background_color=(0,0,1,1),font_size=150) then it tends to error


but here if you are using  ,from kivy.uix.button import Button
it will work in both the cases 

so,here we can pass only one elemrnt from Label function but with Button we can pass one one more than one
